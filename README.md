# GitOps EKS Deployment Project

### In this project I deploy a containerised app using Docker onto AWS EKS with Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, and automate developer changes using GitHub Actions as my CI/CD. I also use helm charts such as NGINX Ingress Controller, External (Dynamic) DNS for automating DNS records, Cert-Manager for automated TLS, ArgoCD for GitOps methodoloy, and Prometheus and Graphana for monitoring and observability
